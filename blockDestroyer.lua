-- THINGS I HAVE TO LEARN TO OPTIMIZE THIS MONSTROSITY: loops; tables; DRY principle
-- to the future lithah; PLEASE CHECK THESE

--THIS WAS DONE WITH AI (gemini); not because i didn't want to do it myself; i tried
-- to optimize the not DRY compliant code; but couldn't; if you wanna check the humanmade code; check 
-- discartedCode.lua; this whole script will reuse this code; and il'l adapt it BY HAND to other
-- repeating code; i tried to make this whole project without AI, but leaving it at the state that it was
-- lagged the game; and was a developing hell; again; im so sorry, im still a newbie, and i wanna learn 
-- the concepts; but i need a few things that are outside of my knowledge right now
