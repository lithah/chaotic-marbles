# AI WAS USED DURING THIS PROJECT (coding only)
Where it was used can be read in the code, i oppose to AI usage; and the fact that i used AI to use something is a fact im not proud of; but it was only used to resume code that i didn't know how to optimise, i hope in the near future i can reduce AI usage until i don't need it.

Check discartedCode.lua to know exactly what was replaced by AI.
